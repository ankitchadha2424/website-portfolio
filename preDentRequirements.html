        <h2>Requirements</h2>
 <p > Two semesters (three quarters) of biology with lab <br>   
Two semesters (three quarters) of general chemistry with lab <br>  
Two semesters (three quarters) of organic chemistry with lab  <br>   
Two semesters (three quarters) of physics with lab.  
 <br> 
 You should also have at least 100 hours of shadowing experience to boost your application
 <br>
  <br>
 Moreover, it is important to make yourself stand out with extracurriculars
 <br>
 Dental related research could help boost your application as well as Dental clubs and volunteer work
 <br>
 But it is also important to show that you have other passions and interests as well
 <br>
 I'd recommend choosing one passion or interest and pursuing it by building history 
 <br>
 The more things you have to talk about the better your interview and application will feel
