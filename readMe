For my website, I wanted to create an informative guide to help someone who is interested in the dental profession when applying to dental schools. This guide helps what schools are available as well as the grade requiremnts to become a successful applicant. It also includes the rankings of dental schools and why some are more prestigious than others. I wanted to make my website clear and concise. There are only two tabs and right now they are very rudimentary but the plan is to insert some sort bio of each school. Obviously it will be impossible for me to map every dental school, but this website includes the Top Ten as an example. Looking more at design elements, I kept the colors simple black and white and the image I used is very modern and sleek. I would like to add more embelllishments in the coming time.
